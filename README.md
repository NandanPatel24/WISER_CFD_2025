# WISER_CFD_2025
A quantum solver for the 1D Burgersâ€™ equation developed for the WISER 2025 Program. This project explores hybrid quantum-classical approaches to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) such as Cole-Hopf Transform and Trotterization. Designed for low-depth, low-qubit, and noise-robust simulation of nonlinear PDEs, with potential scalability to 3D flows.
